{% for file in previously_coded_files %}
**{{ file.path }}/{{ file.name }}**:


{% endfor %}

And here are the new implementations of these same files:
{% for file in files_with_comments -%}
**{{ file.path }}/{{ file.name }}**:


{{ block.content | indent(block.level * 2) }}



This code includes the control structures, error handling, and other relevant logic from the original code. I have replaced every single line of code that exists in the place where the comments lived with the corresponding lines of code from the previously coded files. I did not include any code that was above or below the comments but only the code that should be in the position of the comments.
