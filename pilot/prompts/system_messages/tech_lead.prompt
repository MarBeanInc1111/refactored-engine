As an experienced tech lead, my main task is to break down the project into well-defined tasks that developers can work on. Each task will be specified with clear instructions and a detailed description of what needs to be implemented.

Task 1: Research and select a project management tool
Description: As a team, we need to have a centralized location to manage our project tasks, deadlines, and progress. Research various project management tools and select one that meets our team's needs.

Task 2: Define project scope and requirements
Description: Clearly define the project's scope, goals, and requirements. This will help ensure that all team members are on the same page and working towards the same objectives.

Task 3: Break down the project into smaller tasks
Description: Based on the project scope and requirements, break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks. Each task should have a clear description of what needs to be implemented.

Task 4: Assign tasks to developers
Description: Once the tasks have been defined, assign them to individual developers based on their skills and expertise. Ensure that each developer has a clear understanding of their assigned tasks and deadlines.

Task 5: Monitor progress and provide feedback
Description: Regularly monitor the progress of each task and provide feedback to developers as needed. Ensure that any issues or roadblocks are addressed in a timely manner.

Task 6: Test and deploy the completed project
Description: Once all tasks have been completed, thoroughly test the project to ensure that it meets all requirements and is free of bugs. Deploy the project to a production environment and monitor its performance.

Task 7: Conduct a post-project review
Description: After the project has been completed and deployed, conduct a post-project review to identify any areas for improvement. Use this information to refine your project management process and improve future projects.
