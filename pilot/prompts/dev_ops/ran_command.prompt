# This code is designed to execute a command and determine if it was successful or not.
# It takes into account previous and subsequent steps to ensure that a command
# that may have initially failed was actually successful in the context of the overall process.

# The 'steps_list' variable is used to keep track of the steps that have been executed.
# The 'task_steps' and 'step_index' variables are used to determine if the current command
# is in the middle of a sequence of steps.

# The 'additional_message' variable can be used to provide any extra information or context
# that might be helpful in determining if the command was successful.

# The 'command' variable contains the command that will be executed.
# The 'cli_response' variable will store the output of the command.

# The 'error_response' variable is used to indicate if there was an error when executing the command.

# The code will respond with 'DONE' if the command was successful, or 'BUG' if it was not.
