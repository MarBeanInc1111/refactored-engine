# This code executes a command and checks if it was successful or not, taking into account
# previous and subsequent steps in the overall process.

# The 'execution_steps' list keeps track of the steps that have been executed.
# The 'current_task_step' and 'step_index' variables determine if the current command
 is in a sequence of steps.

# The 'additional_info' variable provides extra context for determining command success.

# The 'command_to_execute' variable stores the command to be executed.
# The 'command_output' variable holds the output of the command.

# The 'error_occurred' variable indicates if there was an error executing the command.

# The code responds with 'DONE' if the command was successful, or 'BUG' if it was not.
